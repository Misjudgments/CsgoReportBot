# CSGO ReportBot
<p>This is a csgo/steam report bot coded using python, to get it working you need to install some pakages:</p>
<p>-pip install bs4</p>
<p>-pip install requests</p>
<p>-pip install pycryptodome</p>

# What you need
<p>First of all you need Steam Accounts that have steam guard disabled (this makes the login process much easier). Then you get the accounts and put them to the usernames/passwords txt file.</p>

<p>Note: make sure that every username is at the same line as the password on the txt files !!</p>

<p>this code works fine on windows, but if you want it to work on linux you need to change os.system('cls') to os.system('clear')</p>

<p>-its better to put the steam accounts into a mysql database to make it easy to manage.</p>

<p>-if there is any mistakes or potential upgrades to the code please contact me.</p>

# How to use it
<p>-git clone https://github.com/den0un/CsgoReportBot.git</p>

<p>-python3 main.py</p>
