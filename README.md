# CSGO ReportBot
<p>This is a csgo/steam report bot coded using python, to get it working you need to install some pakages:</p>
<p>-pip install bs4</p>
<p>-pip install requests</p>
<p>-pip install pycryptodome</p>

Also you need steam accounts to be able to report, the usernames goes to the usernames.txt and the passwords goes to passwords.txt.
its better to put the accounts into mysql database then link it to the code.
