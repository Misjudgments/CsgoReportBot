# CSGO ReportBot
<p>This is a csgo/steam report bot coded using python, to get it working you need to install some pakages:</p>
<p>-pip install bs4</p>
<p>-pip install requests</p>
<p>-pip install pycryptodome</p>

# How it works
<p>First of all you need Steam Accounts that have steam guard disabled (this makes the login process much easier). Then you get the accounts and put them to the usernames/passwords txt file</p>
<p>Note: make sure that every username is at the same line as the password on the txt files !!</p>
